### Project Overview

Robinson Trailers an assignment for the Code Institute Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. I chose this company for my project because I work for it on part time. Each photo in the project was taken by me. For the project, I used a single photo for a given trailer. More detailed and technical photos can be seen on socal media such as Linkedin, Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, Twiter or videos on Tik Tok. After searching for Robinson Trailers.

This store meant to be applicable in a real world scenario. Except of the price being fictional of course. The price is given only for the show of working functions such as sorting the product. From the lowest price to the highest and from highest to the lowest price.

The company offers many different trailers for different sectors, for example I have listed these sectors in the dropdown menu call categories like forestry, construction or special orders.

The focus points for this application are ecommerce, using the Django framework and the ability to go through with a payment for an order.

### Agile Workflow

I have tried to implement the basic Agile strategy, creating issues for my user stories, a Kanban board for the project, Milestones for each epic and moving the stories from to do to done.

1. PEP8 Validation [Link](http://pep8online.com/)

Most of the errors that were shown concerned:
* Missing whitespace around operator
* Expected 2 blank lines, found 1

![](prtsc/images/pep8.png)

2. Flake8

To check the problems invoke the linter manually.
Use command: python3 -m flake8
Which will output all the issues to the terminal.

![](prtsc/images/flake8.png)

I hold ctrl and click on the individual files.
It will take me right to that line where the issue is.

3. HTML Validation [Link](https://validator.w3.org/)

I tested the HTML code by running my server locally by port 8000 and used view page source. This code I passed through the validator. There was a four the same error -li not allowed as a child element in this context. Similar error shown in -ul element.
